*(PS: For optimal use, limit active/ongoing groups to 1 - button will be added automatically for each active group)*

## Env variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet/devnet
```
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_HOST=networkURL
```
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CANDY_MACHINE_ID=candyMachineID
```
*If on Vercel or a similar host you need to add these as environmental variables in your project settings.*

## Troubleshooting

Since the Metaplex official repo only provides you with a very
ugly quickstart example, you may still have to `npm i --force` to
solve some dependency issues (or god knows what else),
and you'll still find a bit of a bungalow down in the console
section of your browser. Just try to ignore that. The Candy Machine
still worked as expected for me. I've had similar or same errors
with the very examples provided by Solana Labs as well.
